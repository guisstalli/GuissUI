You are designing the Consultation module of a professional ophthalmology medical platform.

THIS MODULE IS STRICTLY ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONTEXTUAL.
It MUST NOT contain clinical data.
It MUST NOT replace exams.
It MUST follow strict medical workflow rules.

Do NOT invent fields.
Do NOT merge all components into a single file.
Each screen MUST be implemented as a separate component.

==================================================
MODULE PURPOSE
==================================================

The Consultation module represents the real medical visit context.
It links:
- a Patient
- a date and time
- a status
- optionally an Exam (Child or Adult)

It does NOT store medical or clinical information.

==================================================
CONSULTATION CORE MODEL (CONCEPTUAL)
==================================================

A consultation:
- Belongs to exactly one patient
- Has a consultation type: Child or Adult
- Has a date and time
- Has a status
- May be linked to:
  - zero exam
  - one Child exam
  - one Adult exam
- May be linked to one appointment (optional)

Consultation statuses:
- Planned
- In progress
- Completed
- Cancelled

==================================================
CONSULTATION STATE MACHINE
==================================================

Allowed transitions only:

Planned → In progress
Planned → Cancelled

In progress → Completed
In progress → Cancelled (exceptional)

Completed → no transition
Cancelled → no transition

A consultation is NEVER deleted.
State changes are timestamped.

==================================================
SCREENS TO IMPLEMENT
==================================================

The Consultation module contains EXACTLY TWO screens:

1) Consultations List
2) Consultation Detail

==================================================
SCREEN 1 — CONSULTATIONS LIST
==================================================

Design a consultations list screen.

PURPOSE:
- View all consultations
- Filter activity
- Access consultation context

LAYOUT:
- Table layout only
- No cards

COLUMNS:
- Date
- Time
- Patient full name
- Patient age
- Consultation type (Child / Adult)
- Status (Planned / In progress / Completed / Cancelled)
- Linked exam (None / Child / Adult)
- Action (View or Continue)

FILTERS:
- Date range
- Status
- Consultation type (Child / Adult)
- With exam / Without exam

RULES:
- One action per row
- No inline editing
- Status displayed with clear but subtle badges
- Clicking a row or action opens Consultation Detail

DESIGN:
- Medical-grade
- High readability
- Neutral colors
- No decorative elements

==================================================
SCREEN 2 — CONSULTATION DETAIL
==================================================

Design a consultation detail screen.

PURPOSE:
- Act as a contextual hub for a single consultation
- Allow controlled state transitions
- Provide navigation to exams

--------------------------------------------------
HEADER SECTION (READ-ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------

Display:
- Patient full name
- Patient ID
- Age at consultation
- Consultation type (Child / Adult)
- Consultation date and time
- Current status

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION: ORGANIZATION
--------------------------------------------------

Display:
- Linked appointment (if any)
- Practitioner (if any)
- Administrative notes (optional, non-clinical)

Notes:
- Notes are plain text
- No structured medical fields

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION: LINKED EXAM
--------------------------------------------------

If NO exam linked:
- Display message: "No exam linked to this consultation"
- Display action button:
  - "Create exam" (Child or Adult depending on consultation type)

If exam IS linked:
- Display exam type
- Display exam status
- Display action button:
  - "View exam"

RULES:
- Exams are edited ONLY in exam modules
- No inline exam editing here

--------------------------------------------------
ACTIONS (STATE-DEPENDENT)
--------------------------------------------------

Buttons MUST appear or disappear based on:
- Consultation status
- User role (handled externally)

Possible actions:
- Start consultation (Planned → In progress)
- Create exam
- Link existing exam
- Complete consultation (In progress → Completed)
- Cancel consultation (Planned or In progress)

Each action:
- Requires explicit user intent
- Has a confirmation step if destructive (Cancel)

--------------------------------------------------
UX RULES
--------------------------------------------------

- No clinical fields allowed
- No exam fields displayed
- No scheduling edits here
- No historical data modification

The screen is a coordinator, not a form-heavy interface.

==================================================
NAVIGATION RULES
==================================================

From Consultation Detail:
- Navigate to Exam (read-only or edit depending on permissions)
- Navigate back to:
  - Consultations list
  - Patient Medical Record

==================================================
VISUAL & UX TONE
==================================================

- Professional
- Calm
- Neutral
- Explicit
- Predictable

No animations.
No visual overload.
No decorative UI.

==================================================
FINAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES
==================================================

- Consultation screens are NOT reusable for exams
- Consultation screens do NOT embed medical forms
- One component per screen
- Follow backend logic strictly
- Respect state machine constraints
